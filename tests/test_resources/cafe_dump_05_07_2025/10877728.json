The instrument was designed to gather specific types of information on the household (social) that occupied the housing unit at the time of the flooding. The Wave 1 household survey instrument was designed to collect immediate information on impact, dislocation, and early repair and rebuilding decisions associated with Hurricane Ike. The survey instrument was designed to collect information on: (1) evacuation and reoccupancy of household members with basic information (disruption of major lifeline utilities and tenure status), (2) dislocation/migration (move from your home in the near future), (3) applications to disaster assistance programs (insurance, FEMA, SBA), (4) damage, (5) consumer behavior, (6) additional household socioeconomic and demographics (e.g., highest education status, race/ethnicity, and annual income). The survey was designed to be conducted in-person. Based on the Wave 1 data, the center established a three-year period of panel studies of households, housing units, business owners, businesses, and business structures to track recovery trajectories and adaptive learning."

With funding from the NSF, Dr. Van Zandt and her team at Texas A&M University collected primary data in the months immediately after Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula were struck by Hurricane Ike in September 2008, and again about a year later and two years later. Data was collected from physical assessment of 1500 households. Household surveys were completed for 570 of those households, for a response rate of 38 percent. Business surveys were completed for 287 businesses in Galveston County (including areas on the Island and on the mainland). These data were (and continue to be) used to test hypotheses related to the resiliency and recovery of communities after a natural disaster. We here publish the instruments used to gather the data. The original data is not publicly available due to Institutional Review Board (IRB) restrictions in place at the time of collection. For further questions about the original data you may contact the HRRC at Texas A&M."
