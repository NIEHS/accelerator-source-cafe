The Pacific Northwest Region, which includes Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, is at risk of significant structural and economic damage and widespread loss of life from a massive subduction zone earthquake (7.0+) and resulting tsunami (Cascadia Event). In Oregon, the state is unprepared for the medical care and housing needs after a Cascadia event due to inadequate leveraging of community assets. Because vulnerable groups will experience the greatest and most long-lasting impacts, this research specifically utilized research methodologies aimed at connecting with Latinx community members, who are an ethnic minority in the state. Participant observation was utilized to build relationships and familiarity with the community. For additional documentation and materials regarding the participant observation methodology, please contact the researcher. The results of participant observation and input from community members and advisors were utilized to develop the finalized focus group protocol provided here. Four focus groups were conducted between October-November 2022. Semi-structured interviews were held between November-February 2023. Contained within this collection are the focus group protocol, conceptual mapping activity, demographics questions that were utilized, and semi-structured interview guide, all available in English and Spanish."

Participants were identified through the previously held focus groups as community leaders that could provide valuable insight and context to data collected in the focus group groups. Questions were included that asked them about their role with the organization as their service of the community, as well as their individual experiences as community members and leaders in various capacities. Community adaptive capacity to coastal hazards was addressed or incorporated into multiple questions. Development of this protocol was supported by Dr. Savannah D'Evelyn who shared protocols and insights from work on community exposure to wildfire smoke. Interviews lasted approximately 1 hour and were conducted in both English and Spanish depending on the preferred language of the participant."
