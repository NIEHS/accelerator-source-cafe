The instrument was designed to gather specific types of information on the household (social) that occupied the housing unit at the time of the flooding. The household survey instrument was designed to collect information on a number of features of the housing unit\u2019s occupancy status, either based on determinations made by the interviewing team or on the basis of information obtained from surrounding neighbors, property managers (or some other source), or adult members of the occupying household. The survey instrument was designed to collect information on: (1) disruption of major lifeline utilities (e.g., electricity, natural gas, and water) and communications (phone and internet), (2) an enumeration of household members along with basic demographic information (gender and age), (3) dislocation/displacement with respect to each household member, (4) employment and student status of each member, (5) amount of time each member missed work or school; (6) if others joined the household due to the flooding, (7) tenure status (i.e., rental vs owner), (8) applications to disaster assistance programs (insurance, FEMA, SBA), and (9) additional household socioeconomic and -demographics (e.g., highest education status, race/ethnicity, and annual income)."

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) funded Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning, teamed with researchers from NIST\u2019s Engineering Laboratory (Disaster and Failure Studies Program, Community Resilience Group, and the Applied Economics Office) to conduct a quick response field study to document the initial damage and disruption in the small city of Lumberton, NC caused by the flooding they experienced from the Lumber River. Lumberton is a racially diverse community with higher than average poverty and unemployment rates, a typical civil infrastructure for a city of 22,000 residents, and possesses a small-community structured governance. The November 2016 field study was the first of a series in a longitudinal study to document and better understand the impact that the riverine flooding had on Lumberton and its subsequent recovery. This type of longitudinal research is critical to better understand community resilience and ultimately provide data and insight into making U.S. communities more resilient to natural hazards.  This research is the first application of a combined engineering-social science field study protocol that provides a quantitative linkage between flood damage and socioeconomics, including race, ethnicity, income, tenancy status, and education level. The planning documents archived comprise the field study\u2019s housing unit-level surveys \u2014 including the damage-based and household disruption-based field study instruments \u2014 and business-level surveys for each wave of data collection in the longitudinal study. Material collected are designed to support the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE). IN-CORE is the primary deliverable of the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning a NIST-funded Center of Excellence. For more details visit http://resilience.colostate.edu/in_core.shtml  The perishable nature of natural hazards research requires that teams can quickly organize their efforts before entering the field. This archive is designed to help future research teams with example documents that may help reduce the amount of time needed to invest in project development.
