This report characterizes the diversity, disciplinary skills, and expertise within the research community. It is organized into the following categories: (1) number of researchers; (2) researcher geographic location; (3) disciplinary background and expertise; (4) educational and professional background; (5) level of involvement in hazards and disaster research (core, periodic, situational, emerging); (6) research methods and approaches; (7) disaster types, phases, number of extreme events studied, and names of specific extreme events studied; and (8) researcher demographic characteristics. The document concludes with references for further review and a brief description of the SSEER network. This annual report responds to longstanding calls to better characterize the skills and demographic composition of the hazards and disaster workforce. The 2018-2023 SSEER Census reports are available for download as color and black & white PDF files at: https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/sseer/sseer-census/. Social scientists who study hazards and disasters can become part of this network and annual count by joining SSEER at: https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/sseer/. More information on SSEER and the other National Science Foundation-funded reconnaissance and research networks is available on the CONVERGE website at: https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/."

The SSEER network, which was launched in 2018, was formed, in part, to respond to the need for more specific information about the status and expertise of the social science hazards and disaster research workforce. The mission of SSEER is to identify and map social scientists involved in hazards and disaster research in order to highlight their expertise and connect social science researchers to one another, to interdisciplinary teams, and to communities at risk to hazards and affected by disasters. Ultimately, the goals of SSEER are to amplify the contributions of social scientists and to advance the field through expanding the available social science evidence base. To see the SSEER map and to learn more about the SSEER initiative, please visit:  https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/sseer. All social and behavioral scientists and those in allied disciplines who study the human, economic, policy, and health dimensions of disasters are invited to join this network via a short online survey. This DesignSafe project includes: (1) the SSEER survey instrument; (2) de-identified data, which is updated annually as new researchers join the SSEER network and returning members update their information; and (3) SSEER annual census reports. These resources are available to all who are interested in learning more about the composition of the social science hazards and disaster workforce. SSEER is part of a larger ecosystem of NSF-funded extreme events research and reconnaissance networks designed to help coordinate disciplinary communities in engineering and the sciences, while also encouraging cross-disciplinary information sharing and interdisciplinary integration.
