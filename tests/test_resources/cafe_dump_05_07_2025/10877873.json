This project investigates how individuals with disabilities (PWDs) received and responded to tornado hazard information during the December 10\u201311, 2021 tornado outbreak. The study identifies the barriers PWDs faced in accessing warning information and taking protective actions, as well as the resources that facilitated their ability to act. Using a survey instrument designed specifically for this purpose, the research collects empirical data on topics such as tornado risk perception, protective behaviors, and barriers to action, emphasizing the unique challenges experienced by PWDs in their physical and social environments during severe weather events.  How can data in this project be reused? The data collected from this project can be reused to enhance inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans by identifying key barriers and resources for PWDs during severe weather events. Policymakers, emergency managers, and researchers can leverage the findings to develop equitable warning systems, improve accessibility of shelters, and create inclusive emergency response strategies. Additionally, the survey instrument and dataset can be used in future research to assess similar vulnerabilities and protective behaviors in other disaster contexts or regions, fostering broader application in disaster risk management.  How is this project unique? This project uniquely focuses on the intersection of disability and disaster response, addressing a critical gap in tornado-related research using the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM). The study's emphasis on structural and environmental factors\u2014such as access to transportation, shelters, and communication channels\u2014offers a comprehensive understanding of the disparities PWDs face during tornado events. The findings provide actionable insights for creating inclusive DRR strategies, which are often overlooked in mainstream disaster planning.  Who is the audience? The audience includes policymakers, emergency management professionals, national weather forecasters, academic researchers, and organizations focused on disability advocacy and disaster preparedness. Additionally, the findings are relevant to local government agencies, community planners, and social work practitioners who aim to develop and implement inclusive policies and programs. The project also serves as a valuable resource for scholars studying the intersection of disability, disaster response, and social vulnerability.  This project underscores the importance of addressing the unique needs of PWDs during disasters and contributes to the growing body of knowledge on inclusive disaster preparedness and response. Its findings aim to foster equitable and accessible protective measures, ensuring that no population is left behind in the face of severe weather events."

                                    "value": "The mission of this project was to investigate the tornado preparedness and protective actions of individuals with self-reported disabilities during the December 10-11, 2021 tornado outbreak, with a focus on understanding their experiences, barriers, and resources. Specifically, the research aimed to identify how these individuals received tornado warnings, the factors that impacted their ability to take protective action, and the systemic gaps in warning communication and disaster response for vulnerable populations.  How It Was Tested: The investigation employed a cross-sectional study design, using online surveys distributed via Qualtrics panels. Participants were adults with disabilities residing in tornado-affected counties across Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Arkansas. The survey, conducted from May 20 to May 30, 2022, collected data on how participants received tornado hazard information, the protective actions they were able to take, and the barriers they encountered. The study's structured questionnaire ensured that the data captured was both comprehensive and focused on the experiences of this often-overlooked population.  Outcome: The findings revealed critical insights into the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities during tornadoes. Key barriers to protective action included limited access to timely warnings, physical or mobility constraints, and lack of adequate resources. The study also highlighted gaps in disaster communication systems, underscoring the need for more inclusive and accessible preparedness strategies. These results contribute to advancing equitable disaster planning and improving protective options for people with disabilities.  How the Data Can Be Reused: The data collected from this study can be reused for multiple purposes: 1.  Policy Development: Informing local and federal policymakers to design inclusive disaster communication and preparedness protocols tailored to the needs of people with disabilities. 2. Academic Research: Supporting further studies on disaster equity, accessibility, and vulnerable populations. 3. Community Advocacy: Assisting community organizations and emergency planners in developing targeted interventions and resources. 4. Training and Education: Providing a resource for training emergency responders and educators about the unique needs of individuals with disabilities during tornadoes and other disasters.  By addressing critical gaps in disaster preparedness for individuals with disabilities, this mission contributes to fostering resilience and safety for all community members."
