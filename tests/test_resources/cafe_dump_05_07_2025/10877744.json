                                    "value": "On March 3, 2020, a series of tornadoes struck the state of Tennessee, with two of these categorized as EF-3 with 165 mph winds and the strongest categorized as EF-4 with 175 mph estimated peak wind speeds. Twenty-five fatalities were reported with more than 300 people injured by the event. The counties most impacted by the tornadoes were Benton, Davidson, Putnam, and Wilson Counties. In total, estimates of the losses and damage caused by the tornadoes are between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Resulting damages include road blockages, downed trees and power poles, power outages, and damaged or completely destroyed structures. Given the large number of buildings located in the path of the tornadoes, a large amount of construction and demolition (C&D) debris was anticipated. The total volume of debris from residential, commercial, and school buildings in Benton, Davidson, Putnam, and Wilson Counties estimated in this project using the EPA\u2019s disaster debris estimation tool, I-WASTE, is 479,300 cubic yards. In total, 400 waste management facilities of varying types (e.g., landfills, composting facilities, and transfer stations) were identified in the state of Tennessee. With regards to material recovery facilities, which can critically affect the feasibility of recycling, 20 material recovery facilities were identified in Davidson County, 3 in Putnam County, and 9 in Wilson County. Based on the composition of the debris estimated in this project and the types of debris accepted by the available material recovery facilities, recycling reinforced concrete and steel, in addition to the structural and nonstructural building materials, is feasible with the presence of metal and C&D material recovery facilities. Given the sheer magnitude of the debris generated by the tornadoes, this event offers an opportunity to advance our knowledge on proper planning for and sustainable management of disaster debris to maximize benefits from the materials through reuse and recycling and to minimize adverse effects on human health and the environment. This project encompasses the products of SUMMEER's virtual response to this disaster event: Virtual Assessment Report (VAR)."

As this product is based on virtual reconnaissance alone, the VAR does not include detailed field investigative research. The content of this VAR is based on available online data, actual testimony from affected groups, as well as feedback collected from contacts and representatives in the field, when available.
