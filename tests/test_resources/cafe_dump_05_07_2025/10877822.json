This project was designed to assess how state-level VOADs can build capacity to address children\u2019s needs before, during, and after disaster. Children are an important group. One-quarter of the U.S. population is children under the age of 18, and they are especially vulnerable to disasters\u2014yet they are often overlooked in disaster planning and response.     This project involved multi-method research in the focal states of Arkansas and Nebraska and in collaboration with members of VOADs, emergency management, and child serving organizations in both states. The evaluation team conducted participatory engagement exercises, survey research, secondary data analysis and GIS mapping, and a social network analysis survey. Key findings from both states included:     (1) VOAD\u2019s are likely to respond to children and families in a disaster. In our initial survey, more than 80% of participants from Arkansas and 76% of participants from Nebraska selected that their organizations would be \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201clikely\u201d to assist children and/or families during a catastrophic disaster and more than 72% of respondents from Arkansas and 68% of respondents from Nebraska selected that their organization would be \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201clikely\u201d to assist children and/or families during a low-attention disaster.     (2) VOAD\u2019s are not fully ready to meet children\u2019s needs in a disaster. When asked whether respondents had \u201cpersonally received training related to protecting children in emergencies,\u201d 56% of Arkansas participants reported \u201cno,\u201d whereas 47% of Nebraska participants reported \u201cno.\u201d A majority of respondents in each state, however, selected that their organization is either \u201cknowledgeable\u201d or \u201csomewhat knowledgeable\u201d (Arkansas: 71%; Nebraska: 57%) about the needs of children during disasters.  (3) VOAD organizations face a number of constraints that impede their ability to collaborate and appropriately address children\u2019s disaster-specific needs. In both states, \u201cinsufficient funding\u201d was the most reported concern or challenge that affected organizations\u2019 ability to respond effectively to disasters. Other frequently reported constraints included challenges with \u201cmaintaining high quality staff/volunteers,\u201d \u201cinsufficient equipment or other material resources,\u201d and difficulties associated with \u201cinter-organizational coordination.\u201d  Within the social network analysis surveys for both Arkansas and Nebraska, participants shared feedback regarding the challenges of collaboration. These included: a lack of resources, staff turnover, time constraints, geographic distance, and different styles of communication.   (4) Rural areas are under-represented in state-level VOAD structures and therefore children living in these areas are likely to be underserved during times of disaster. Participatory asset mapping activities in both states revealed critical gaps in service provision for rural areas, with metropolitan areas receiving the most attention in terms of organizational representation and resources.  Analysis of secondary data and interactive GIS maps also revealed a dearth of child-serving organizations in rural areas, despite high levels of social vulnerability among children and their families within these areas.   (5) There are many unrealized opportunities for the exchange of child-specific resources among organizations within VOADs. According to findings from the social network analysis, child-specific networks for exchanging resources were among the least cohesive of all the networks measured in the survey. This means that when comparing the different types of resource exchange networks, such as those that exchange information or technical assistance, there were fewer established networks and opportunities for exchanging child-specific resources within both state VOADs. In fact, the survey showed that many organizations within each state were not seeking child resources at all. In both Arkansas and Nebraska, the social network analysis also revealed low levels of interaction within the VOADs. This may negatively affect organizations\u2019 ability to provide and coordinate child-specific resources and services to communities affected by disaster.   Based on these findings, this report recommends adopting the five state-level indicators to help assess and monitor state progress in building capacity to address children\u2019s needs in disaster."

This project was designed to assess the capacity of state-level VOADs to address children\u2019s needs before, during, and after disasters. This project involved multi-method research in the focal states of Arkansas and Nebraska and in collaboration with members of VOADs, emergency management, Save the Children, and other child-serving organizations in both states. The evaluation team conducted participatory engagement exercises, survey research, secondary data analysis and GIS mapping, and an interorganizational network analysis survey. This project includes research instruments and the final reports produced as part of this project. The envisioned audience for these materials includes researchers, emergency managers, and professionals who work for child-serving organizations."
