Most actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts are common sense investments that will offer protection against natural climate variations and extreme events. In addition, crucial investment decisions made now about equipment and infrastructure can \"lock in\" commitments to greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. Finally, while it may be possible to scale back or reverse many responses to climate change, it is difficult or impossible to \"undo\" climate change, once manifested.

For each workshop, location-specific brochures describing observed climate trends and projected future climate conditions were developed using information from the 2014 National Climate Assessment and other peer-reviewed science at the regional and local scale. Participants used climate change scenarios to consider impacts on sectors like agriculture, water, infrastructure, health and social services, and natural assets and ecosystem services. This brochure was used for the second workshop, which took place in Fort Collins, CO, with support from the State of Colorado and DOE.",

USDA led the production of the report on behalf of the thirteen Federal Agencies of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Thirty-one authors and contributors-- representing nineteen federal, academic, nongovernmental, and intergovernmental institutions in four countries-- prepared the report.. In response to the PCAP, this report integrates research from the biophysical and the social sciences across multiple sectors in order to evaluate climate-driven changes in global food security and analyze the U.S. role in food security in a changing world.",

El Programa de los Estados Unidos de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre el Cambio Mundial (USGCRP) llev\u00f3 a cabo esta evaluaci\u00f3n sobre el clima y la salud con la finalidad de entender esta creciente amenaza y de fundamentar las decisiones con respecto a ella. Esta evaluaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica, establecida de conformidad con el Plan de Acci\u00f3n del Presidente frente al cambio clim\u00e1tico, es un informe muy importante acerca del proceso sostenido de Evaluaci\u00f3n Nacional del Clima (NCA). El informe responde al mandato emanado del Congreso en 1990 de ayudar a todo el pa\u00eds a entender, evaluar y predecir los procesos del cambio mundial, tanto natural como inducido por el hombre, y c\u00f3mo responder ante \u00e9l. Los organismos que integran el USGCRP determinaron que los impactos sobre la salud humana constitu\u00edan un tema de suma prioridad para la evaluaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica.\n\nLa finalidad de esta evaluaci\u00f3n es presentar una estimaci\u00f3n integral, fundamentada en la evidencia y, siempre que fuese posible, tambi\u00e9n cuantitativa de los impactos observados y proyectados sobre la salud que tiene el cambio clim\u00e1tico en los Estados Unidos. La evaluaci\u00f3n sobre el clima y la salud efectuada por el USGCRP est\u00e1 destinada a informar a los funcionarios de salud p\u00fablica, a los planificadores urbanos y de la respuesta ante los desastres, a los responsables de la toma de decisiones y otros interesados directos, dentro y fuera del gobierno, que procuran entender mejor los riesgos que el cambio clim\u00e1tico plantea a la salud humana.

This new report highlights notable accomplishments of the program, both in through its coordinating work and the many synthesis and assessment products it has published to share research findings with decision makers and the public.One of the first priorities of the program was to address the need for a global observational system. Today there is a large and growing portfolio of global measurements from space designed to inform global change science.

USGCRP has also made considerable strides in making scientific knowledge more useful to decision makers. For example, it has documented substantial increases in heavy downpours in most regions of the United States over the past 50 years, which can cause flooding that overwhelms the existing infrastructure of sewers and roads. Awareness of such trends can help governments, businesses, and citizens respond accordingly in many realms, including agriculture, conservation, and human health.In the face of increasing impacts from climate change and other global changes, the report recommends that the USGCRP build on its accomplishments by sustaining, expanding, and coordinating observations of the Earth system and maintaining a balanced program of discovery-driven and use-inspired research to support the needs of the nation at local, regional, national, and global scales. USGCRP will need to make further progress in incorporating the social sciences into its work to provide the information needed to effectively and efficiently manage current and likely consequences of global change.",
