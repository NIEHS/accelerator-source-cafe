These plans were approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) between 2016-2021. This data publication includes: (1) the SHMP qualitative dataset; (2) a data dictionary with description of each variable output; (3) variable definitions for relevant terms and socially vulnerable populations included in SHMPs; and (4) a READ ME file with important information. The dataset was generated through systematically reviewing publicly available plans and adding quotes and locations of different terms and mentions or descriptions of socially vulnerable populations. This dataset allows for qualitative analysis of the terminology, descriptors, and prevalence of how these populations are included (or excluded) in SHMPs. The envisioned audience for this data and information includes government officials, researchers, and others who are interested in understanding how social vulnerability is defined and how socially vulnerable populations are characterized in SHMPs."

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approves SHMPs every five years as a requirement to be eligible to receive funding for FEMA disaster relief grants and disaster mitigation projects. As of April 2023, updated FEMA policy guidance for SHMPs is in effect that calls for greater community engagement in the planning process and stipulates that plans consider equity and climate change. In response to these changes, this project takes the position that more robust conceptualizations of socially vulnerable populations and inclusive use of social vulnerability data can help states in the development of multi-hazard risk assessments. Social vulnerability emerges from systemic inequities, resulting in populations facing disproportionate impacts in disasters. It is a helpful framework for identifying underserved and marginalized populations. Given the crucial importance of considering social vulnerability in mitigation planning, our research team developed two novel datasets with descriptive data of the populations, definitions, and different measures of social vulnerability included in SHMPs for all 50 states and 5 inhabited U.S. territories. Specifically, this project includes two datasets: (1) a quantitative dataset where mentions of socially vulnerable populations and concepts are marked with a binary indicator of inclusion or exclusion in the State Hazard Mitigation Plan and (2) a qualitative dataset that contains quotes and locations of populations and concepts throughout each SHMP. The corresponding mission for each dataset includes: (1) the State Hazard Mitigation Plan dataset; (2) a data dictionary with description of each variable output; (3) variable definitions for the population groups included in State Hazard Mitigation Plans; and (4) a READ ME file with important information. These datasets and associated materials can help State Hazard Mitigation Officers and their technical partners identify gaps in addressing social vulnerability as they update the SHMPs for the areas they serve. These resources are available to researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and others who are interested in addressing social vulnerability in hazard mitigation planning."
