It will deploy a bilingual (Spanish-English) survey based on the Integrated Fire Management approach principles that prioritizes prevention and suppression strategies while considering social, economic, cultural, and ecological assessments. This approach has been instrumental \"for planning and operational systems aiming at minimizing the damage from and maximizing the benefits of fire\" (Fischer et al., 2016). The survey will also follow the Shared Wildfire Governance (SwG) paradigm that focuses on identifying the range of key actions necessary to 'thrive with fire,' emphasizing that wildfires can occur anywhere; however, the dynamics and vulnerabilities of socioecological systems vary across geographies and populations (Tedim et al., 2019). The study has followed four methodological stages: 1. Purposive literature review; 2. Questionnaire preparation guided by SwG principles and the iterative review and adjustments from the Texas Forest Service team; 3. Translation of the survey into Spanish; and 4. Publication of the instrument on the DesignSafe website. During this process, the research team has employed concepts and practices of convergent research (Peek et al., 2020) and co-production of knowledge (Kliskey et al., 2023) instrumental in advancing collaborative efforts to escalate the survey results in the Texas Forest Service and WUI regional coordinators. The survey is aligned with contemporary wildfire management and social vulnerability paradigms, potentially influencing updates to Texas Community Wildfire Protection Plan Guides (Texas A&M, Forest Service, 2012) and bilingual educational resources (e.g., Ready, Set, Go!).

Tailored for Spanish-speaking and bilingual respondents, the survey instrument would serve to capture linguistic-cultural, and socioeconomic aspects influencing wildfire preparedness, and potential contributing to strengthen targeted strategies, interventions, and policies aimed at enhancing readiness and resilience within these communities. Objective: To assess the social and wildfire vulnerability among Hispanic/Latino communities in Texas regarding wildfire threats in WUIs.  Research questions: How do linguistic-cultural, and socioeconomic factors of Hispanic/Latino communities in Texas influence their preparation and readiness capacity for wildfires in WUIs? Related, how these dimensions affect the social and wildfire vulnerability experienced by the targeted community? Questionnaire topics: The survey will cover a range of topics encompassing risk perception, information accessibility, socio-economic conditions, community engagement, and linguistic-cultural factors influencing preparedness. Each domain will be aligned with the Integrated Fire Management approach and Shared Wildfire Governance paradigm, ensuring holistic coverage of wildfire vulnerability facets. The survey will be potentially divided in four segments: Social and Wildfire Vulnerability: The survey delves into understanding the unique vulnerabilities of Hispanic/Latino communities regarding wildfire risks, considering their geographical locations, and exposure to these threats. Linguistic Challenges: It explores linguistic barriers and challenges faced by respondents in comprehending wildfire risk information and emergency communication, addressing the impact of language on their preparedness. Socioeconomic and Sociodemographic Factors: Assessing the socioeconomic situations affecting communities\u2019 ability to prepare for wildfires, the survey examines demographic composition, economic disparities, access to resources, and other socioeconomic determinants influencing preparedness measures. WUI Challenges: Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges specific to preparing for wildfires within WUIs, where human settlements intersect with wildland or vegetative fuels, amplifying the risks faced by communities. Methodology and scope: The survey utilizes a bilingual (English-Spanish) approach to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for respondents. It will be designed to be administered primarily on an internet-based platformto facilitate accessibility and wider reach. Sampling Method: Although the survey will not be deployed, the bilingual instrument is expected to be fielded using random sampling to ensure representation across WUIs with diverse population densities and wildfire risks. Similarly, it will be a cross-sectional survey that will be located at a single point in time to capture perceptions and behaviors related to wildfire vulnerability among the target population. Peer Review and Validation: Details the process of expert review and validation by the Texas Forest Service team. Their input and expertise ensure the survey's alignment with regional wildfire dynamics and community needs."
