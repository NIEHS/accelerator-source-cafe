As this product is based on virtual reconnaissance alone, the VAR does not include detailed field investigative research. The content of this VAR is based on available online data, actual testimony from affected groups, as well as feedback collected from contacts and representatives in the field, when available.

The collapse resulted in a total of 98 fatalities and 11 injuries. The structure was part of a complex of three buildings. On July 4, 2021, the remaining section of the Champlain Towers was demolished, as it was dangerously unstable based on structural engineering assessments. The amount of the generated debris was estimated in this project using EPA\u2019s Incident Waste Assessment and Tonnage Estimation (I-WASTE) tool. I-WASTE results indicated that a total of 11,000 tons of debris were generated \u2013 6,000 tons from the collapsed section and 5,000 tons from the demolished section. Reinforced concrete and steel were estimated to constitute 43% of the generated debris, and non-structural building materials, such as drywall, carpet, and wood, made up approximately 36% of the debris. In terms of waste management facilities, eight C&D recyclers, six electronics recyclers, three metal recyclers, nine transfer stations, two operational municipal solid waste landfills, and one operational C&D waste landfill were identified in Miami-Dade County. Given the nature of this anthropogenic event (i.e., singular structural collapse) and its atypical governing conditions (i.e., ongoing investigation and litigation regarding the cause of the collapse), it provides unique opportunities for investigating the feasibility of sustainable management of disaster debris through reuse and recycling amid intricate management conditions (e.g., debris heterogeneity and potential contamination, associated human factors, and issues in debris clearance and subsequent processing). This project encompasses the products of SUMMEER's virtual response to this disaster event: Virtual Assessment Report (VAR)."
