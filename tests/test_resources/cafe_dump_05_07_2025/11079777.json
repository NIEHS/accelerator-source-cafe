Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.\n<br />\n<br />\nUnderstanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.\" \n<br />\n<br />\n[Quote from https://data.cdc.gov/National-Institute-for-Occupational-Safety-and-Hea/The-effects-of-diesel-exhaust-inhalation-on-cardio/jgkt-w9bh/about_data] (2024-04-22)"

There are, however, a few exceptions. A federal government website may have a mix of public domain and copyright-protected materials. First, some resources, as well as images, on the CDC and ATSDR websites are restricted in their use because they were developed by government contractors or grantees, or have been licensed by a third party. Second, the U.S. government work designation does not apply to works of state and local governments; works of state and local governments may be protected by copyright. Third, copyright laws also differ internationally. While U.S. federal copyright laws may not protect U.S. government works outside the United States, the work may still be protected under the copyright laws of other countries when used in these jurisdictions. Copyright-protected materials featured on the CDC and ATSDR websites should include a copyright statement. However, if in doubt, please write to the contact point for that site. The following requirements must be followed to utilize CDC\u2019s public domain content: 1) Attribution to the agency that developed the material must be provided in your use of the materials. Such attribution should clearly state the materials were developed by CDC ATSDR and/or HHS (e.g., \u201cSource: CDC\u201d; \u201cMaterials developed by CDC\u201d); 2) You must utilize a disclaimer which clearly indicates that your use of the material, including any links to the materials on the CDC, ATSDR or HHS websites, does not imply endorsement by CDC, ATSDR, HHS or the United States Government of you, your company, product, facility, service or enterprise. All such disclaimers must be prominently and unambiguously displayed (e.g., \u201cReference to specific commercial products, manufacturers, companies, or trademarks does not constitute its endorsement or recommendation by the U.S. Government, Department of Health and Human Services, or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 3) You may not change the substantive content of the materials; and 4) You must state that the material is otherwise available on the agency website for no charge. Note: Many of CDC\u2019s on-line publications are continually updated as the agency learns more about a specific disease or condition. Occasionally, sites that copy and re-post CDC materials fail to check for updates, which may result in out-of-date information being offered to users. For that reason, we urge you to link directly to our resource documents rather than re-posting. If you do re-post, please check back periodically to see if there are revisions. Linking to CDC, ATSDR or HHS content should open up a new browser window to our site/page. CDC content should not appear within the original window, framed by the existing site.\""
