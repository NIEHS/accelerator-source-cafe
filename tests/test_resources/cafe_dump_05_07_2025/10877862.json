Community-identified assets are particularly important places in which social capital is built and maintained.  Yet community assets are often under-utilized in developing equitable hazard mitigation strategies.  Like critical facilities, these assets may experience severe supply chain disruptions after hazardous events due to building vulnerability, infrastructure disruption, and/or debris accumulation.  Identifying community assets can increase disaster resilience through the incorporation of multi-use strategies aimed at strengthening both the physical structures and accessibility of identified community assets.  This, in turn, may increase the day-to-day benefits to community members which rely upon and build different types of capitals found within these asset spaces.  The survey instrument includes open and closed response questions that identify community assets, their associated values, perceived uses and values after a disaster, preference for future community mitigation actions, and demographics.   Assets identified can be geocoded for a variety of geospatial analyses, including network analysis.  The survey can be adapted to specific hazards and areas. Both English and Spanish versions are available here.  Please note:  Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the survey instrument for ages 13 and up.  Additional IRB approval will be needed before using the instrument and may require modification in the consent language and minimum age of the participant."
