The model estimates emissions, energy units and economic factors across a wide range of material types commonly found in municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris in the following categories:\n<br>\n<br>\nMetric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E),\nEnergy units (million British Thermal Unit - BTU),\nLabor hours,\nWages ($), and\nTaxes ($).\nWARM is currently available as a downloadable Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n<br>\n<br>\nPotential GHG savings are calculated by comparing the estimated emissions associated with managing materials under an alternative scenario with the estimated emissions associated with the user\u2019s baseline scenario (i.e., current practices), as opposed to simply multiplying the quantity of materials managed by an emission factor. For example, the GHG savings of recycling one (1) short ton (standard U.S. ton) of aluminum cans instead of landfilling them would be calculated as follows:\n<br>\n<br>\n(1 short ton \u00d7 -9.13 MTCO2E/short ton) - (1 short ton \u00d7 0.02 MTCO2E/short ton) = -9.15 MTCO2E\nWARM is periodically updated as new information becomes available and new material types are added. Users may refer to the model history to better understand the differences among various versions of WARM. WARM was last updated in December 2023. WARM was not developed for and should not be used for final site-specific materials management decisions, when other human health and environmental impacts of the different management methods may need to be considered (such as air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, etc.). WARM is a comparative tool rather than a comprehensive measurement tool. It also should not be used for developing GHG inventories, which need to establish a baseline and measure reductions over time on an annual basis for an entity.\"\n<br>\n<br>\n[Quote from <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/warm/basic-information-about-waste-reduction-model\">https://www.epa.gov/warm/basic-information-about-waste-reduction-model</a>]"

These emission factors include:\n\nThe energy and emissions associated with transporting materials,\nOperating the digester,\nAvoided utility emissions from biogas combustion,\nAvoided fertilizer application, and\nFugitive emissions and soil carbon storage resulting from the application of digestate to agricultural soils.\nThe anaerobic digestion pathway in WARM includes options for the user to model both a wet or dry digester system. WARM also allows the user to model the application of digestate to agricultural soils with or without curing. Additionally, EPA revised the method for calculating energy and emissions from the transportation of materials to landfills, combustors, composting facilities, and anaerobic digesters. Each of these pathways use a consistent source for transportation impacts per mile and ton of waste transportation.\n\nIn addition, EPA made regular updates to various factors in the model using current data sources. The latest 2014 statistics on the carbon content of fuels, landfill methane generation distribution (by type of landfill), and landfill gas recovery and flaring rates have been incorporated from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2014. The non-biogenic carbon content of mixed municipal solid waste was updated using annual waste disposal data from EPA's Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures Fact Sheet. Various aspects of the U.S. average electricity mix were updated based on the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Agency's 2015 Monthly Energy Review. State electricity grid emission factors were updated based on the 2015 update to the eGRID database. EPA updated material properties for biodegradable materials used in modeling anaerobic digestion and landfilling based on recent papers and research. These properties include carbon content, carbon storage factors, and methane yield. These updates resulted in changes to the majority of emission factors in WARM.\n\nVersion 14 is also the first WARM version to be incorporated into a tool based on a database developed in openLCA software.

The majority of the updates in WARM version 13 concern the model\u2019s handling of organics, including new source reduction emission factors for food waste, an updated methodology for estimating landfill gas emissions, the inclusion of fugitive gas emissions from composting, and updates to the global warming potential values in the model.\n\nAdditions in March 2015 Update\nEPA added source reduction emission factors for two meat food waste types: beef and poultry. These emission factors include the energy and emissions associated with the upstream production of food products from farm to retail. EPA also updated the weighted average mixed food waste categories to include three options: \"Food Waste\", a weighted average of all food waste types in WARM; \"Food Waste (meat only)\", a weighted average of beef and poultry; and \"Food Waste (non-meat)\"; a weighted average of grains, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. Source reduction was added as an alternative material management pathway for mixed paper (all types), mixed metals, and mixed plastics. EPA corrected errors that had applied incorrect landfilling emission factors when users selected certain landfill management options or scenarios in the tool. EPA also corrected an error that caused the incorrect regional electricity grid to be applied when some states were selected.\n\nAdditions in June 2014 Update\nEPA added source reduction emission factors for several non-meat food waste types: grains, bread, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. The revisions to the landfilling waste management pathway, prepared using a landfill gas Monte Carlo analysis model developed by James Levis and Morton Barlaz, more accurately estimate the fraction of total produced landfill gas that is used beneficially, flared, and vented to the atmosphere at landfills that manage landfill gas. This analysis improves upon the landfill gas collection efficiency modeling in WARM and updates the methane oxidation rates. In addition, the Excel version of WARM now allows users the option of selecting and reviewing results based on California regulatory gas collection scenario as one of four landfill gas collection scenarios. For information on the major changes to the landfill emissions methodology for WARM version 13, please see the Landfilling Chapter and the Landfill Gas Monte Carlo Model Documentation and Results. The composting pathway has been updated to include emissions of CH4 and N2O occurring during the composting process based on recent literature estimates.\n\nGWP values in WARM have been updated to include those from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. In addition, EPA made its regular updates to various factors in the model using current data sources. The latest 2012 statistics on the carbon content of fuels, landfill methane generation distribution (by type of landfill), and landfill gas recovery and flaring rates have been incorporated from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2012. Retail transport emissions for various materials were updated based on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2012 Commodity Flow Survey. The non-biogenic carbon content of mixed MSW was updated using annual waste disposal data from EPA's Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, Facts and Figures. Various aspects of the U.S. average electricity mix were updated based on EIA's 2014 Monthly Energy Review while state electricity grid emission factors were updated based on the 2014 update to the eGRID database. These updates resulted in changes to the majority of emission factors in WARM.",

WARM now also includes a source reduction factor for mixed electronics that excludes cathode ray tube displays (for which a source reduction factor is not applicable because these types of displays are no longer produced).\nEPA updated factors for wood flooring and wood products based on new data sources. Updates to the wood flooring material include revisions to the source reduction factor and the addition of reuse as a new management pathway (modeled under the recycling management pathway in WARM) for wood flooring. EPA also updated the source reduction and reuse factors for dimensional lumber.

In the latest version, the source reduction entry was revised, so it will accept negative inputs. Access the updated  Excel-Based Tool: Version 15 (xls) (3.43 MB) (December 18, 2023).\n\nThe main changes to WARM Version 15 include replacing personal computers with more specific electronics categories, incorporating economic impacts into the model, and updating the various factors in the model using current data sources. In addition, users are now easily able to see the production and end-of-life greenhouse gas and energy impacts along with other results.\n\nEPA replaced personal computers with the following electronic materials categories:  \n\nDesktop Central Processing Units,\nPortable Electronic Devices,\nElectronic Peripherals,\nCathode Ray Tube Displays,\nFlat-Panel Displays,\nHard-Copy Devices, and\nMixed Electronics.\nPrior to the release of WARM Version 15, WARM did not include potential economic benefits from waste reduction or alternative waste management practices. The update to WARM Version 15 includes economic impacts from employment (labor hours), wages and taxes. The economic impacts include the direct impacts associated with the actual transformation of recyclable materials into marketable products. They also include indirect impacts, including the collection, sorting and transportation of a material.\n\nIn addition, EPA reorganized the order of materials in WARM and made regular updates to various factors in the model using current data sources. The latest 2016 statistics on the carbon content of fuels, landfill methane generation distribution (by type of landfill), and landfill gas recovery and flaring rates have been incorporated from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2016. The non-biogenic carbon content of mixed municipal solid waste was updated using annual waste disposal data from EPA's Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures Fact Sheet. Various aspects of the U.S. average electricity mix were updated based on the U.S. Department of Energy Energy Information Administration's 2017 Monthly Energy Review while state electricity grid emission factors were updated based on the 2018 update to the eGRID database. These updates resulted in changes to most emission factors in WARM.\n\nVersion 15 is also available in a tool based on a database developed in openLCA software. OpenLCA is a free, open-source software for life cycle assessment developed by GreenDelta. Further information about openLCA can be found on the openLCA website and within the WARM Version 15 user guide. ",

In this latest version of WARM, the interface displays results in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent as the default unit for GHG emissions, but results are still available in units of metric tons of carbon equivalent. Additionally, this version of WARM no longer maintains macros. The removal of macros does not affect the results or functionality of the tool. All of the energy and emissions (both MTCO2E and MTCE) results are displayed automatically.\n\nNew emission factors were added for four plastics, linear low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl Chloride. Additionally, new emission factors were developed for polylactide and aluminum ingot. Several other emission factors were revised:\n\nthe emission factor for aluminum cans has been updated to include additional can manufacturing steps in the updated life cycle data as well as factor in industry-specific electricity grid mix assumptions,\nthe combustion and open-loop recycling pathways for residential broadloom carpeting now incorporate new data from Dr. Matthew Realff and\nthe emission factors for three plastics, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate were updated using new life-cycle data.\nThe mixed recycling and mixed plastics recycling factors have both changed due to:\n\nrevisions to the underlying numbers in the virgin and recycled HDPE and PET emission factors,\nthe removal of the LDPE recycling pathway and\nupdates to the waste generation and recovery numbers based on EPA's \"Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: Facts and Figures\" report.\nFor information on the major changes to the updated Aluminum Cans and new Aluminum Ingot material GHG emission and energy Factors for WARM version 12, please see the Aluminum FAQ document. \n\nIn addition, EPA made its annual updates to various factors in the model using current data sources. The latest 2010 statistics on the carbon content of fuels, landfill methane generation distribution (by type of landfill), and landfill gas recovery and flaring rates have been incorporated from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2009. The non-biogenic carbon content of mixed MSW was updated using annual waste disposal data from EPA's Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, Facts and Figures and BioCycle's State of Garbage in America report. Various aspects of the U.S. average electricity mix were updated based on EIA's 2010 Annual Energy Review while state electricity grid emission factors are updated based on the eGRID database.",

Several other emission factors were revised:\n\nthe emission factor for aluminum cans has been updated to include additional can manufacturing steps in the updated life cycle data as well as factor in industry-specific electricity grid mix assumptions,\nthe combustion and open-loop recycling pathways for residential broadloom carpeting now incorporate new data from Dr. Matthew Realff and\nthe emission factors for three plastics, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate were updated using new life-cycle data.\nThe mixed recycling and mixed plastics recycling factors have both changed due to:\n\nrevisions to the underlying numbers in the virgin and recycled HDPE and PET emission factors,\nthe removal of the LDPE recycling pathway and\nupdates to the waste generation and recovery numbers based on EPA's \"Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: Facts and Figures\" report.\nFor information on the major changes to the updated Aluminum Cans and new Aluminum Ingot material GHG emission and energy Factors for WARM version 12, please see the Aluminum FAQ document. \n\nIn addition, EPA made its annual updates to various factors in the model using current data sources. The latest 2010 statistics on the carbon content of fuels, landfill methane generation distribution (by type of landfill), and landfill gas recovery and flaring rates have been incorporated from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2009. The non-biogenic carbon content of mixed MSW was updated using annual waste disposal data from EPA's Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, Facts and Figures and BioCycle's State of Garbage in America report. Various aspects of the U.S. average electricity mix were updated based on EIA's 2010 Annual Energy Review while state electricity grid emission factors are updated based on the eGRID database.",
